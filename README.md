# Peak-graph-based-Fast-Density-Peak-Clustering-for-Image-Segmentation
We proposed an fast DPC-based clustering algorithm (PGDPC) for image segmentation which is published in IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS, 2021. Doi: 10.1109/LSP.2021.3072794
The proposed algorithm has three contributions
1) PGDPC with time complexity O(nlog(n)) can handle large datasets rapidly; 
2) the peak-graph-based allocation strategy can integrally reconstruct the spatial information of complex-shaped clusters; 
3) PGDPC is found superior to some popular state-of-the-art methods when applied to real image segmentation.
